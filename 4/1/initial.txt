initial

The initial CSS keyword applies the initial (or default) value of a property to an element. It can be applied to any CSS property,
 including the CSS shorthand property all. With all set to initial, 
 all CSS properties can be restored to their respective initial values in one go instead of restoring each one separately.

On inherited properties, the initial value may be unexpected. 
You should consider using the 

inherit, unset, revert, or revert-layer keywords instead.

Using initial to reset color for an element
HTML

<p>
  <span>This text is red.</span>
  <em>This text is in the initial color (typically black).</em>
  <span>This is red again.</span>
</p>

CSS

p {
  color: red;
}

em {
  color: initial;
}


 This text is red. This text is in the initial color (typically black). This is red again. 

 With the initial keyword in this example, color value on the em element is restored to the initial value of color, as defined in the specification.

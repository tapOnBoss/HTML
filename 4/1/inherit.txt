Inherit
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit 
Inheritance is always from the parent element in the document tree, even when the parent element is not the containing block.

/* Make second-level headers green */
h2 {
  color: green;
}

/* Leave those in the sidebar alone so they use their parent's color */
#sidebar h2 {
  color: inherit;
}

so color would be green for #sidebar h2

div#current {
  color: blue;
}
But this block element would be blue


    Inheritance
    Use the initial keyword to set a property to its ' initial ' value.
    Use the ' revert '  keyword to reset a property to the value established by the user-agent stylesheet (or by user styles, if any exist).
    Use the ' revert-layer ' keyword to reset a property to the value established in a previous cascade layer.
    Use the ' unset ' keyword to set a property to its inherited value if it inherits or to its initial value if not.
    The ' all ' property lets you reset all properties to their initial, inherited, reverted, or unset state at once.

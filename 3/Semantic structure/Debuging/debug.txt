DEBUGING BROWSERS USING
DEVELOPER TOOLS or Web DEVELOPER Tools

chrome
https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/

safari
https://developer.apple.com/safari/tools/

i would love to use firefox instead cuz chrome has way to many trackers and complicated settings with low security measures
firefox has high security, fast searching in all search engines, fast response to AI generators.
Understands a lot of programing languages.
Good for game dev, web dev, visual dev, fullstack dev, devops, frontend dev, backend dev.
Would also use custom made search engines for privacy measures and security.

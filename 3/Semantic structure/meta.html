<!-- Hello, I will be your assistant when writing HTML and CSS code -->
<!-- I speak in comments to tell you what certain lines mean -->
<!-- So, now that it is obvious how a comment looks like, let's look at HTML! -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML> <!-- We are telling the browser that we are using HTML5 -->
<html> <!-- This tells the browser where HTML code begins -->
	<head> <!-- This element opens the head of the website and shows all the thoughts it contains - none that are directly visible in the website (e.g. the author, the charset or other files) -->
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /> <!-- Let's tell the browser that we are using UTF-8 charset, it is the standard we'll use and ensures that all characters are displayed correctly -->
		
		<title>Website Template for UCL students</title> <!-- We tell the browser what title this page has - it will be displayed in the browser's toolbar, search engine (e.g. Google) and in case you bookmark it -->
	</head> <!-- We are closing the thoughts of the website (as you can see, we close pretty much every HTML element) -->
	
	<body> <!-- This line tells the browser where content begins. Almost everything in the body tags will be visible to the user -->
		<h1>
			This is a heading! There are 6 heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 - where h1 has the highest importance and h6 has the lowest.
		</h1>
	
		<p>
			This is text in a paragraph! Paragraphs are block elements, whereas <span>span</span> is an inline-element. 
			Imagine a block as a box, whereas an inline-element like a plastic bag - we can build various structures by putting a box on a box, whereas plastic bags either wrap-up content or sit next to each other. 
			Best way to figure out how they work is to play around with them!
		</p>
	</body> <!-- We are telling the browser that we are ending all the content -->
</html> <!-- This tells the browser where HTML code ends -->

<!-- The terminology in this document used is not official and should not be used in documents (e.g. coursework report). It is here to simplify HTML -->
